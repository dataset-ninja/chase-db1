**CHASE DB1: Retinal Vessel Reference Dataset** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the medical research. 



The dataset consists of 28 images with 28 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*vessel*).

Images in the CHASE DB1 dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the semantic segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into an object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2012 by the [Kingston University, London](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/) and [St. George's, University of London](https://www.sgul.ac.uk/).

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
