**CHASE DB1** is a dataset for instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the medical industry.

The dataset consists of 28 images with 28 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*vessel*).

Images in the CHASE DB1 dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds0* (28 images). The dataset was released in 2016 by the [Kingston University London](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/).

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
