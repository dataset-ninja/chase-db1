**CHASE DB1: Retinal Vessel Reference Dataset** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the medical research. 

The dataset consists of 28 images with 28 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*vessel*).

Images in the CHASE DB1 dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2012 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Kingston University, London</span> and <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">St. George's, University of London</span>.
